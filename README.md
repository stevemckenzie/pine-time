# Pine Time

A app for pulling in historical weather data from Environment Canada for the purpose of knowing when mushrooms will grow. Eventually we will have some prediction models in place.

This is also an app for teaching @veronika-s how to build a React app. We will start off with a more simplified approach and eventually upgrade everything to TypeScript, fully tested, E2E with Cypress, Storybook, etc...

## Available Scripts

* `yarn run start` (development mode with hotreloading)
* `yarn run build` (production build)
* `yarn run test` (run tests - but we do not have any yet)
* `yarn run deploy` - (deploy to GitHub Pages)
